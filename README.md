# TechMindCourse
This project is to get to know about the GitHub flow.
If you are a project manager, recruiter, or product manager, you have to communicate with developers, dive into their work, or just smile and nod. TechMind course will help you quickly learn the basics and understand the whole development process. In two months you will learn the terminology, best practices, and how to communicate with technical specialists in their language.
